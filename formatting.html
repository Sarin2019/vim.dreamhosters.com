<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>vim offers several tools to format the file you're working on. One example is that you can set it to only allow lines to be a certain amount of characters.</p>

<h1>Setting each line to allow a specific amount of characters</h1>
<p>Let's say you need all lines in your file to never exceed 80 characters. This example shows how to set the word-wrapping variable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the file in vim.</li>
<li>While still in COMMAND mode, enter the following:
<div class="preboxcontainer">
<pre class="prebox">
<span class="server">[server]$ </span><span class="command">:set tw=80</span></pre></div></li>
<li>Click 'ENTER'.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you edit the file now, all lines will cap at 80 characters.</p>
